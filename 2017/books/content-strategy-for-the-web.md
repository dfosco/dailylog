# Content Strategy for the Web

### Foreword

 - I needed to find a way to introduce real content strategy into a system that was hardwired to reject anything that might gunk up the works.

 - Instead, I heeded the "move fast" writing on the walls and focused on gaining quick wins.

 - A quick checklist for success
  + Demonstrate value on your own terms
  + Apply content strategy to your content strategy
  + Friend everyone

### Introduction

 - We wrote this book for people who want to understand what content strategy is, why it's important, and how to go about getting it done.

 - Some specific topics the book _does not cover_:
  + Translation and localization
  + Content marketing
  + Social media planning
  + SEO
  + CMS strategy (software selection, design, and implementation)

 - You can redesign a homepage. You can buy a new CMS. But unless you treat your content with strategic consideration, you can't fix your website.


### NOW

   2. Figure out what you have and where it's coming from.
   3. Learn how to listen.
   4. Put someone in charge.
   5. Take action... now.
