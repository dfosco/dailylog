# Notes on 'The Design of Everyday Things'

### Affordances

A chair affords ("is for") support, and therefore affords sitting.

_has_ affordance: `true | false`

_affords_:

```javascript
 let affordance = true

 affordance = {
   sitting: true
   lifting: false
   wheeling: false
 }
```

**Affordance** = qualities of the object + abilities of the agent ~~~ a relationship (not a property)

anti-affordance: negatives that the object expresses (nono's)

### Signifiers

 - Affordances determine what actions are possible, while signifiers communicate where the action should take place.

 - Good design requires good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to people who use it.

**That is the role of the signifier**

We need to develop internal models of what things mean.

**We are detectives**

### Mapping

 - The relationship between the elements of two sets of things.

 - In steering a car, we rotate the steering wheel clockwise to cause the car to turn right: the top of the wheel moves in the same directions as the car.

 - The relationship between a control and its results is easiest to learn wherever there is an understandable mapping between the controls, the actions, and the intended result.

    + Natural mapping [...] leads to immediate understanding.

 - A device is easy to use when the set of possible actions is visible, when the controls and displays exploit natural mappings.

### Feedback

**Feedback**: Some way of letting you know that the system is working on your request.

 -  Even as simple a task as picking up a glass with the hand requires feedback to aim the hand properly, to grasp the glass, and to lift it.

- Too many announcements cause people to ignore all of them, or wherever possible, disable all of them, which means that critical and important ones are apt to be missed. Feedback is essential, but not when it gets in the way of other things, including a calm and relaxing environment.

 - Feedback has to be planned. Feedback must also be prioritized, so that [...] important signals are presented in a way that does capture attention.

### Conceptual Models

 - A conceptual model is an explanation, usually highly simplified, of how something works.

 - [...] there are no folders inside the computer — those are effective conceptualizations designed to make them easier to use.

 - Simplified models are valuable only as long as the assumptions that support them hold true.

 - Mental models [...] are the conceptual models in people's minds that represent their understanding of how things work.

    + Different people may hold different mental models of the same item.

 - Usually the device offers very little assistance, so the model is constructed by experience.

 - The major clues to how things work from their perceived structure — in particular from signifiers, affordances, constraints and mappings.

> **Conceptual model >>> device**  
> **Mental model >>> user**  

- Conceptual models are valuable in providing understanding, in predicting how things will behave, and in figuring out what to do when things do not go as planned. **A good conceptual model allows us to predict the effect of our actions [as users].**

- Understand the relationship between the controls and the outcomes.

### The System Image

- I call the combined information available to us the _system image_.
