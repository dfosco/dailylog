# Notes on 'The Design of Everyday Things'

### Affordances

A chair affords ("is for") support, and therefore affords sitting.

_has_ affordance: `true | false`

_affords_:

```javascript
 let affordance = true

 affordance = {
   sitting: true
   lifting: false
   wheeling: false
 }
```

**Affordance** = qualities of the object + abilities of the agent ~~~ a relationship (not a property)

anti-affordance: negatives that the object expresses (nono's)

### Signifiers

 - Affordances determine what actions are possible, while signifiers communicate where the action should take place.

 - Good design requires good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to people who use it.

**That is the role of the signifier**

We need to develop internal models of what things mean.

**We are detectives**

### Mapping

 - The relationshop between the elements of two sets of things.

 - In steering a car, we rotate the steering wheel clockwise to cause the car to turn right: the top of the wheel moves in the same directions as the car.

 - The relationship between a control and its results is easiest to learn wherever there is an understandable mapping between the controls, the actions, and the intended result.
    + Natural mapping [...] leads to immediate understanding.
