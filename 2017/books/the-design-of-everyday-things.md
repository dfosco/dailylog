# Notes on 'The Design of Everyday Things'

### Affordances

A chair affords ("is for") support, and therefore affords sitting.

_has_ affordance: `true | false`

_affords_:

```javascript
 let affordance = true
 
 affordance = {
   sitting: true
   lifting: false
   wheeling: false
 }
```

**Affordance** = qualities of the object + abilities of the agent ~~~ a relationship (not a property)

anti-affordance: negatives that the object expresses (nono's)

### Signifiers

Affordances determine what actions are possible...

... while signifiers communicate where the action should take place.

Good design requires good communication of the purpose, structure, and operation of the device to people who use it.

**That is the role of the signifier**

We need to develop internal models of what things mean.

**We are detectives**
